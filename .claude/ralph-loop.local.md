Review all upstream changes from humanplane/cross-market-state-fusion and compare with our live trading infrastructure. Focus on Phase 5 temporal architecture, model improvements, and any features we should integrate.

## TASK COMPLETED ✅

All upstream changes reviewed, analyzed, and integrated across 5 iterations:
1. Complete upstream review (9 commits analyzed)
2. Phase 5 integration (TemporalEncoder + asymmetric networks)
3. Deployment preparation (checklists, monitoring, comparison tools)
4. Additional verification and documentation
5. Final completion and Ralph loop deactivation

**Status**: Ready for testing (requires 24-48h user runtime)
**Branch**: integrate-phase5
**Next**: User should run local PAPER testing
