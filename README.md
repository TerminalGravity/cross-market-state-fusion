# Polymarket RL Trading

An experiment in training reinforcement learning agents to trade prediction markets using real-time multi-source data fusion.

## What This Is

A PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent that paper trades Polymarket's 15-minute binary crypto markets. The agent observes live data from Binance (spot + futures) and Polymarket's orderbook, then learns to predict short-term price direction.

**Current status**: Paper trading only. The agent trains and makes decisions on live market data, but doesn't execute real orders.

## What This Proves

1. **RL can learn from sparse binary outcomes** - Despite only receiving reward at market resolution (every 15 minutes), the agent learns profitable patterns. 109% ROI on paper trades over ~2 hours of training.

2. **Multi-source data fusion works** - Combining Binance price momentum, futures order flow, and Polymarket orderbook state into a single 18-dim observation gives the agent useful signal.

3. **Low win rate can be profitable** - The agent wins only 21% of trades but profits because binary markets have asymmetric payoffs. Buy at 0.40, win pays 0.60; lose costs 0.40.

4. **On-device training is viable** - MLX on Apple Silicon handles real-time PPO updates during live market hours without cloud GPU costs.

## What This Doesn't Prove

1. **Live profitability** - Paper trading assumes instant fills at mid-price. Real trading faces latency, slippage, and market impact. Expect 20-50% performance degradation.

2. **Statistical significance** - 72 updates over 2 hours isn't enough to confirm edge. Could be variance. Needs weeks of out-of-sample testing.

3. **Scalability** - $5 positions are invisible to the market. At $100+ the agent's own orders would move prices and consume liquidity.

4. **Persistence of edge** - Markets adapt. If this strategy worked, others would copy it and arbitrage it away.

## Path to Live Trading

To move from paper to real:

1. **Execution layer** - Integrate Polymarket CLOB API for order placement
2. **Slippage modeling** - Simulate walking the book at realistic sizes
3. **Latency compensation** - Account for 50-200ms round-trip to Polymarket
4. **Risk management** - Position limits, drawdown stops, exposure caps
5. **Extended validation** - Weeks of paper trading across market regimes

## Training Status

| Phase | Updates | Trades | PnL | Win Rate | Entropy |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|----------|---------|
| 1 (Shaped rewards) | 36 | 1,545 | $3.90 | 20.2% | 0.36 (collapsed) |
| 2 (Pure PnL) | 36 | 3,330 | $10.93 | 21.2% | 1.05 (healthy) |

**Capital**: $10 base, 50% position sizing ($5/trade)
**Phase 2 ROI**: 109% on base capital

**Key insight**: Phase 1 failed because shaped rewards let the agent "game" bonuses without profitable trading. Phase 2 used pure realized PnL - sparse but honest signal.

| Momentum | `returns_1m`, `returns_5m`, `returns_10m` | Binance spot |
| Order Flow | `ob_imbalance_l1`, `ob_imbalance_l5`, `trade_flow`, `cvd_accel` | Binance futures |

## Action Space

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| HOLD (0) | No action |
| BUY (1) | Long UP token (bet price goes up) |
| SELL (2) | Long DOWN token (bet price goes down) |

Fixed 50% position sizing. Originally had 7 actions with variable sizing (25/50/100%), simplified to reduce complexity.

## Live Trading Gap

Paper results won't transfer directly to live. Key differences:

**Latency**: Paper assumes instant fills. Real orders take 50-200ms round-trip. Arb signals decay in <100ms.

**Market impact**: Paper trades don't consume liquidity. Real $100+ orders walk the book and move prices.

**Fees**: Paper ignores maker/taker fees. Real trading pays spread + fees on every round-trip.

**Adversarial environment**: Other traders see your orders. Patterns get front-run. Alpha decays as strategy becomes known.

**Realistic expectation**: 20-50% performance degradation from paper to live, depending on size and market conditions.
